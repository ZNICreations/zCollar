## üíç About The Project

zCollar is a modified fork of OpenCollar, with active development while keeping up the Open-Source Standards - and even going a bit further.
Besides the usual open source standards, we focus on community-led development.

Of course, there are excellent open source projects that rely entirely or mostly on a single vendor, but open source is most innovative and sustainable when maintained by a community.

Therefore, feel free to review open bug reports and feature requests and, if necessary, work them out with users to get involved in the development process.



## ‚ù§Ô∏è  Community and Contributions

zCollar is a **community-driven open source project**. We are committed to a fully transparent development process and **highly appreciate any contributions**. Whether you are helping us fixing bugs, proposing new feature, improving our documentation or spreading the word - **we would love to have you as part of the zCollar community.**
